  # Intelligent Traffic Control System ðŸš¦

This project implements a **Dynamic and Intelligent Traffic Control System** using a **Deep Double Q-Network (D3QN)** to optimize traffic flow at a four-way intersection. The system dynamically adjusts traffic lights based on real-time vehicle counts, prioritizes roads with heavy traffic, prevents starvation, and incorporates energy-saving and safety features.

## **Features**

1. **Dynamic Traffic Signal Management**:  
   Adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic data to ensure smooth flow.

2. **Prioritization Algorithm**:  
   Reduces congestion by prioritizing roads with higher vehicle counts and preventing starvation.

3. **Night-Time Safety Mode**:  
   - Switches off traffic lights during low-traffic hours to save energy.  
   - Activates flashing lights to warn speeding vehicles approaching from side roads.

4. **Emergency Vehicle Priority**:  
   Detects emergency vehicles and switches to an emergency mode to provide them with a green signal.

5. **High-Beam Detection at Night**:  
   Detects vehicles with high-beam headlights and warns drivers to dim their lights, improving safety for oncoming traffic.

6. **Reinforcement Learning (D3QN)**:  
   Utilizes Deep Double Q-Learning to dynamically learn and optimize traffic light decisions over time.
